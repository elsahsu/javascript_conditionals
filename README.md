Q3-1:
Using the flowchart below, write the code to represent checking your balance at the ATM. The yellow diamonds represent conditional statements and the blue rectangles with rounded corners represent what should be printed to the console.

Q3-2:
Write an if...else statement that:
prints "even" if the number is an even number
prints "odd" if the number is an odd number

Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:

If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.

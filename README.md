Q3-1:
Using the flowchart below, write the code to represent checking your balance at the ATM. The yellow diamonds represent conditional statements and the blue rectangles with rounded corners represent what should be printed to the console.

Q3-2:
Write an if...else statement that:
prints "even" if the number is an even number
prints "odd" if the number is an odd number

Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:

If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.

Q3-3:
Write a series of conditional statements that:
prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4
prints "this is a large group" if musicians is greater than 4

If musicians equals 3, then trio should be printed to the console.
If musicians equals 20, then this is a large group should be printed to the console.
If musicians equals -1, then not a group should be printed to the console.

Q3-4:
Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:

four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
and four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...

the poison belongs to the ballroom,
the trophy belongs to the gallery,
the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
and the knife belongs to the dining room.
And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.

Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.

To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
sets the value of weapon based on the room and
sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room

Afterwards, print the following to the console if the mystery was solved.
Fill in the blanks with the name of the suspect, the room, and the weapon. For example,
Mr. Parkes did it in the dining room with the knife!

Q3-6:
Using logical operators, write a series of complex logical expressions that prints only if the following conditions are true:
if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and
if vessel is set to cone or bowl and
if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts
If the above conditions are true, then print out:
I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________.
Fill in the blanks with the flavor of the ice cream, vessel, and toppings. For example,
I'd like two scoops of vanilla ice cream in a cone with peanuts.
